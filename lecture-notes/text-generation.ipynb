Large language models (often called *chatbots*) are one familiar technology that uses text generation, while autocomplete features on websites and your devices are another. The text generation task is: \n",

At first glance, it may not appear that text generation involves any prediction at all. However, modern approaches to text generation rely fundamentally on supervised learning through the framework of *next token prediction*. \n",

In some cases, each token might be a single character: \"a\" is a token, \"b\" is a token, etc. In other cases, each token might be a word.
